                <h4>Topography</h4>
                <p>Topography is the study and description of the surface features of land, which includes both natural and artificial features. In this unit the focus will be on 'Natural Topographical' features of Pakistan.</p>
                <p>Pakistan can be divided into six major natural topographical areas.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Northern Mountains and North-Western Mountains</li>
                    <li>The Western Mountains</li>

                <h4>The Northern Mountains and North-Western Mountains</h4>
                <p>To the north, north-east and north-west of Pakistan there lie three ranges of mountains. Amongst these ranges are the great Himalayas which the people of central and south Asia consider to be the roof of the world.</p>
                <p>The Himalayas stretch continuously for about 2500 km from east to west. They are bordered to the north-west by the mountain ranges of the Hindu Kush and to the north by the Karakoram. Fig. 1.3 shows that the Northern Mountains comprise of three main mountain ranges: the Karakoram, the Himalayas and the Hindu Kush.</p>
                <p>The clash of these three great ranges makes for a very interesting and complex geology in northern Pakistan.</p>

                <h4>a) The Karakoram Range</h4>
                <p>(Average altitude about 6000 m)</p>
                <p>The Karakoram, meaning 'black gravel', is a mass of rock and ice, extending for more than 400 km from Hunza to the Shyok River. The western end of this range lies in Pakistan.</p>
                <p>The range runs east-west, has deep, narrow valleys and sharp peaks thus forming a very rugged landscape. The average height of the mountains is about 6000 metres. K-2, the second highest peak in the world (8610 metres), is located here.</p>
                <p>The precipitation is mainly in the form of snow because of the high altitude. In the upper regions of these valleys there are glaciers instead of rivers. The severe climate makes the Karakorams extremely inhospitable so this region has a low population density. The mountain passes are open only for half of the year, during summer. A nomadic or semi-nomadic way of life is common. Agriculture is practised in those valleys where water is plentiful. Apples, barley and millet are the main products. Cattle breeding is also common.</p>
                <p>However, the Karakorams have always attracted scientists and mountaineers from all over the world because of their challenging geography and scenic beauty. Recently, the construction of the Karakoram Highway to China has opened a new era in the cultural and economic progress of the region.</p>

                </figure>

                <h4>b) The Himalayas</h4>
                <p>(Average altitude about 4000 m)</p>
                <p>The Himalayas are to the south of the Karakoram range. They run east to west. They comprise the Siwaliks, the Lesser or Lower Himalayas and the Central Himalayas. The Siwaliks are the low altitude (600 - 1200 metres) hills located near Attock. The Lesser, or Lower Himalayas, are of medium altitude.</p>

                <p>(1800 - 4500 metres) and are represented by the Pir Panjal range. They are of special interest to tourists, with some popular hill stations e.g. Murree, Nathia Gali and Ghora Gali, located there.</p>
                <p>Moving north, the height of the mountains increases. The mountain range, which is located between the Pir Panjal Range and the Karakoram Range, is called 'The Central Himalayas'. This part of the Himalayas mostly lies in Kashmir. The natural topography of this area is characterised by snow-capped, steep-sided peaks, with huge glaciers causing deep erosion, and by rich natural vegetation in the valleys. The highest peak of this range, Nanga Parbat, with a height of about 8126 metres, lies in the Northern Area.</p>
                
                <h4>c) The Hindu Kush</h4>
                <p>(Average altitude about 5000 m)</p>
                <p>The Hindu Kush Range lies where the borders of Afghanistan and China meet on Pakistan's north and north-west border. This range runs in a north-south direction. With mountains like Tirich Mir (7690m) and large glaciers it resembles the Karakoram Range.</p>
                <p>The photograph, Fig. 1.5, shows part of the Swat River valley. The high, steep valley sides and the fast flowing river, which occupies most of the narrow valley floor, are features typical of the relief and drainage in the Hindu Kush and other parts of the Northern Mountains. Through the centuries, the passes across the Hindu Kush have been of immense historic and military significance. Many invaders, e.g. Alexander the Great, Mahmud of Ghazni, the Ghauris, Timurlane and the Mughal king Babar, crossed the Hindu Kush through these passes. Passes are still important today. The Shandur Pass connects Gilgit and Chitral, the Shangla Pass links the Swat valley to the upper part of the Indus valley and the Lawarai Pass connects Chitral to the Swat Valley and the Vale of Peshawar. Generally the mountains are bare of vegetation, though some rich forests are found in the extreme south-east as well as in the hills of Swat, Kohistan, the Panjkora valley and Dir District. Rice is cultivated on terraced fields of the Hindu Kush mountains in areas of Swat, Chitral and Dir.</p>

                <h4>The Mountain Valleys</h4>
                <p>In the mountainous north, a number of valleys attract many domestic and foreign visitors. The larger, more popular ones are:</p>
                <ol type="i">
                    <li>Swat (Hindu Kush)</li>
                    <li>Chitral (Hindu Kush)</li>
                    <li>Dir (Hindu Kush)</li>
                    <li>Gilgit (Karakoram)</li>
                    <li>Hunza (Karakoram)</li>

                    <li>Kaghan (Himalayas)</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Importance of the Northern Mountains</h4>
                <p>The Northern Mountains hold immense importance because of a number of economic and physical factors given in Fig. 1.9.</p>

                <figure>

                            <li>Mountain peaks provide protection to Pakistan against the cold winds from Central Asia. The temperature does not go below freezing point over the upper Indus Plain and climate remains tolerable throughout the year.</li>
                            <li>A source of valuable minerals, timber and fruits. Provides raw material to several industries e.g. furniture, paper, chipboard industry, chemical industry etc.</li>
                            <li>Scenic beauty promotes tourist resorts which are a source of income to local people during summer.</li>

                <h4>People and Economy in the Northern Mountains</h4>
                <p>The population, settlement, and economic activities within the Northern Mountains have been greatly influenced by the variations in topography, which impose harsh living conditions and restrict movement and communications.</p>
                <p>The economy in the Northern Mountains developed on traditional lines. Much of the Northern Mountains area is characterized by a very low economic growth rate combined with a high rate of population growth, which prevents growth in the already low level of per capita income (average income per person).</p>

                <figure>
                    <div class="placeholder-image">Image of a traditional wooden bridge.</div>
                    <figcaption>(Fig. 1.10) A traditional wooden bridge on River Swat, Kalam. The people use this bridge for crossing the river. The bridge seems to be very unstable and risky for crossing, especially if people are carrying some luggage. The pace of development in the northern areas has remained slow, due to lack of income to pay for the improvement of communications.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                
                <p>The photograph, Fig. 1.10, shows that life is difficult in the Northern Mountains due to lack of infrastructure facilities e.g. bridges over the rivers and roads. Most of the population is dependent on agriculture, primarily subsistence agriculture and cattle breeding. Farming is practised on terrace fields where wheat, rice, barley, maize and vegetables are grown.</p>

                <h3>Page 5: Economic Activities in the Northern Mountains (Continued)</h3>
                <p>During winter many people work in cottage and small-scale industries. The outputs of these industries are carpets, embroidered material, rugs and other handicraft items. The domestic and foreign tourists who visit these places, mainly during the summer season, value these products. The major industries include the processing of food grains, making vegetable oil, and refining sugar. Fruit processing is also an important industry. Fig. 1.11 shows an apricot drying unit in Baltistan.</p>
                <p>There are a few modern industries but mineral resources have not been explored as yet. The Northern Mountains have major hydro-electric potential, but the development of hydro-electric resources requires huge capital investment, which is not available. The skilled labour needed to organize and manage the development of natural resources is also limited due to the low literacy rates. Most of the people face a shortage of safe drinking water and poor health.</p>
                <p>Moreover, food production in the Northern Mountains has not kept up with the population growth so they also face malnutrition.</p>
                <p>Some of the towns in the Northern Areas like Mingora, Murree, Kaghan and Gilgit have regional trade by road with cities like Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Peshawar and Abbotabad. However, due to difficult terrain and limited transport facilities it is difficult to carry out regional trade on a large scale.</p>
                <p>Tourism is also popular in the Northern Mountains but it has had an adverse impact on regions where tourist numbers exceed the facilities available.</p>

                    <div class="placeholder-image">Image of Saiful Maluk Lake.</div>
                    <figcaption>(Fig. 1.19) Saiful Maluk Lake is another example of a cirque. It is located in the northern end of Kaghan Valley at an altitude of 3,224 m (10,578 feet) above sea level. It is among one of the highest lakes in Pakistan attracting a number of local and foreign tourists.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                
                <h4>Glaciers</h4>
                <p>Many of the world's glaciers lie in the mountains of Pakistan. A glacier is a tongue shaped mass of ice moving slowly down a valley.</p>
                <p>Some of the important glaciers are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Baltoro:</strong> 58 km long, in the Karakoram Range.</li>
                    <li><strong>Batura:</strong> 58 km long, in the Hunza valley in the Karakoram Range.</li>
                    <li><strong>Siachen:</strong> 78 km long, located in the Karakoram Range.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>How glaciers change the landscape</h4>
                <p>Like rivers, when glaciers move down, they do three things:</p>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>erosion (abrasion and plucking) of soil and rocks - these form their load</li>
                    <li>transportation of their load</li>
                    <li>deposition of their load.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The glaciers can be very large e.g. the Siachen Glacier is 78 km long. A glacier also causes erosion as it moves down a valley (Fig. 1.20).</p>

                <div class="question-box">
                    <h5>How Ice Erodes</h5>
                    <p>Ice erodes the valley sides and floor by:</p>
                    <ol type="i">
                        <li><strong>abrasion</strong> which is the scraping of the surface by rocks frozen into the moving ice.</li>
                        <li><strong>plucking</strong> which occurs when ice freezes onto rock surfaces and pulls off pieces or blocks of rock when it moves again.</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                
                <p>Some of the features of glaciation formed in high altitude mountainous regions are mentioned below:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Snowfield</strong> is a plain area covered with perpetual snow above the snowline in high altitude mountains.</li>
                    <li><strong>Serrated landscape</strong> (elevated mountain zone used for agriculture)</li>
                    <li><strong>Bare rocks</strong> in high altitude areas above the snowline (rocks without vegetation due to accumulation of snow)</li>
                    <li><strong>Scree</strong> (a slope consisting of accumulation of loose rock debris. It is formed when water in the cracks of the rock freezes, expands and exerts great pressure within the rock.)</li>
                </ul>

                </figure>

                <p>The rock breaks up and debris collected at the foot of the hill slopes is called scree.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Deep V-shaped valleys / gorges (steep sided deep river valleys)</li>
                    <li>Formation of U-shaped valleys due to movement of glaciers</li>
                    <li>Deeply dissected landscape due to movement of glaciers</li>
                    <li>Cirque/corrie (a steep walled basin resulting from frost and glacial action. In some cases it contains a small lake. For example Lake Saiful-Muluk located in Kaghan valley and Satpura Lake near Skardu are cirques).</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Drainage Features of the Northern Mountains</h4>
                <p>The term 'natural drainage' means the natural run-off of water from an area in rivers and streams. 'Drainage pattern', 'drainage system' and 'network of rivers' are terms used to describe the natural drainage of areas.</p>
                <p>The River Indus and its tributaries, which originate from the Northern Mountains, dominate the drainage pattern of the Northern Mountains. The River Indus starts its journey from Manasarovar Lake in the Karakoram Range. While passing through the Hindu Kush to the north-west, at Attock, River Kabul joins River Indus which is already joined by River Swat. After forming deeply dissected valleys and gorges, River Indus takes a southern turn at Kalabagh and enters into plain areas. During its journey the huge glaciers of the Karakoram and Hindu Kush feed the river.</p>
                <p>Similarly the eastern tributaries of River Indus (Ravi, Jhelum, Chenab, Sutlej, Beas) originate from the Himalayas and, after passing through Kashmir, enter into the plain area where they join River Indus.</p>

                <div class="q-box">
                    <p>"The Northern Mountains should be developed for tourism by providing infrastructure facilities. This will generate employment for the local population. Increase in GDP will promote economic growth of the country."</p>
                    <p>"The Northern Mountains are difficult to develop because of topographical constraints and environmental damage. It is more economical to develop the Indus Plain than the Northern Mountains."</p>
                    <p><strong>Which statement do you agree with more? Give reasons for your answer and refer to places or examples you have studied in Pakistan to support your answer.</strong></p>
                </div>

                <p>While crossing the high altitude mountain ranges, River Indus and its tributaries form features which are normally associated with river action in all high altitude areas such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>gorges</strong> when the river erodes the land and flows downhill, the less resistant rocks are eroded leaving behind vertical hard rocks which are called gorges (Fig. 1.24)</li>
                    <li><strong>waterfalls</strong> a steep fall of river water from a resistant rock</li>
                    <li><strong>rapids</strong> a series of very short and fast waterfalls</li>
                    <li><strong>streams and springs</strong> when the snow melts from the mountain tops water flows down in form of streams and springs which flow out of the valley side.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>The Western Mountains</h4>
                <p>The Western Mountains consist of many parallel ranges and are not as high as the Northern Mountains. Fig. 1.25 shows the Western Mountains include the following ranges.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Safed Koh Ranges up to 4712 metres</li>
                    <li>Waziristan Hills up to 3513 metres</li>
                    <li>Sulaiman Range up to 3383 metres</li>
                    <li>Kirthar Range up to 2174 metres</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>Safed Koh Ranges</h5>
                <p>The Safed Koh Ranges are located in an east-west direction south of the Kabul River. They are called Safed Koh (White mountains) because their peaks are often covered with snow. Fig. 1.25 shows that the River Kurram flows to the south of this range and the Kurram Pass provides a route into Afghanistan.</p>
                <p>The Kohat Valley is located at the other end of the Kurram Pass. It is dotted with springs and a number of limestone ridges. With the help of irrigation, the valley is farmed. Wheat, rice and sugar-cane are cultivated there.</p>
                <p>Another valley in this region is the Vale of Peshawar, (Fig. 1.25) drained by the Rivers Kabul and Swat. It is a fertile, alluvial plain irrigated by canals originating from the Warsak Dam on the River Kabul.</p>

                <h5>Waziristan Hills</h5>

                <h5>The Active Flood Plain</h5>
                <p>The narrow strip of land on both sides of the rivers is called the active flood plain area (Fig. 1.51). It is locally known as 'bet' or 'khadder' land. It is inundated almost every year. At the end of the rainy season, the land is marked with dry and braided channels rich in alluvium (Fig. 1.54 a-b). The active flood plain is found along all the rivers except for the southern half of River Ravi due to the low volume of water. When the River Indus enters the lower Indus Plain, the flood plain is around 40km wide which makes it an important farming area.</p>
                <p>Meanders, oxbow lakes and levées are important features of the active flood plain. Fig. 1.55. explains how the river forms meanders and oxbow lakes through acts of erosion and deposition. Formation of levées is explained in Fig. 1.56 when the river deposits material on its bank. These features exist in both the Upper and Lower Indus Plains.</p>

                <h5>The Old Flood Plain</h5>
                <p>Meander and cover flood plains cover the area between the alluvial terraces (discussed later) and the active flood plain. They are only flooded when there is heavy monsoon rainfall. They are covered with 'old alluvium', alluvium deposited in the past.</p>
                <p>Features found on the old flood plain include abandoned channels, meander scars and the remains of ox-bows, sometimes still with some water in them.</p>

                <h5>Alluvial Terraces</h5>
                <p>Alluvial terraces or bars are areas of higher ground between rivers formed by erosion of old alluvium. They are formed in the Upper Indus Plain in Chaj, Rechna and Bari Doabs. They are also called 'scalloped interfluves'. Sandal Bar on Rechna Doab, Ganji Bar on Bari Doab, Nili Bar on Bari Doab and Kirana Bar on Chaj Doab are prominent alluvial terraces.</p>
                <p>The surface of the alluvial terraces is flat and has a south-west slope. The terraces are considered ideal for agriculture with the help of irrigation facilities. The location of alluvial terraces can be seen in Fig 1.50. Part of the Bahawalpur Plain that has been reclaimed through irrigation also falls within the boundary of the Indus Plain.</p>

                <h5>Cross Section of a Doab</h5>
                <p>A doab is the land located between two rivers at the confluence. When the rivers enter into a mature valley a number of topographical features are formed on a doab due to the process of erosion and deposition. These features are levées, active flood plain, old flood plain (meander flood plain (M), cover flood plain(C)), scarp (a long steep slope or cliff at the edge of a plateau or ridge; usually formed by erosion), bar upland or alluvial terraces, etc. as labelled on Fig. 1.59.</p>

The horizontal measurement shows the distance from the river in kilometres, e.g. the active flood plain is located 15 kilometres away from the river. The vertical measurement shows the height from the level of the river in metres. For example one bar upland is 12 metres higher than the level of river and one active flood plain is 4 metres higher than the level of river.</figcaption>

                <h3>Page 23: The Indus Plain (Continued)</h3>
                <p>Doabs are favoured as areas for a number of human activities such as farming, construction of settlements, building of transport links (rail tracks and roads), and other industrial and business activities etc. A number of topographical features contribute to a high population density in doab areas of Pakistan e.g.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>the active flood plain is flooded nearly every year so it is an ideal land for the crops which require plenty of water such as rice, sugar-cane etc.</li>
                    <li>meander flood plains and cover flood plains are good locations for arable farming (growing crops) in fertile areas. The poor soils could be used for human settlements.</li>
                    <li>there is a well-developed link canal irrigation system in doab areas leading to a continuous supply of water throughout the year.</li>
                    <li>the bar uplands are safe from being flooded, as they are higher places. They are ideal locations for farming and human settlements, transport links, industrial estates, storage of agricultural raw material and markets.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>Piedmont Plains</h5>
                <p>Piedmont Plains are located at the foothills of the Sulaiman, Kirthar and Himalayan Mountains (Fig. 1.25). The most dominant features of the Piedmont Plains are the alluvial fans or cones that develop eastward from the Sulaiman and Kirthar Mountains. Figs 1.60 a and b explain the formation of alluvial fans. Most of the rivers or streams coming from the Sulaiman and Kirthar Ranges have low water flows. They become active only during the rainy season, when they flow down the mountain slopes swiftly. As they reach the foothills, they become slow and split into narrow channels that fan out on to the slopes. The material brought down by the water is dropped within the narrow channels of the streams. The gravel, sand and alluvium deposited by rivers form alluvial fans. The Sulaiman Piedmont plain is also known as Derajat.</p>
                
                <h5>Tidal Delta</h5>
                <p>The Indus delta is located to the south of Thatta (Fig. 1.62). The formation of the delta is shown in Fig.1.61. A delta is often triangular or fan shaped with the main distributaries branching out from the main river like the ribs of a fan. When a river flows into the sea, its speed is soon checked and its load of alluvium is dropped on the sea floor. Deposition of alluvium on the banks of the distributaries makes the level of the levées higher than the adjacent areas. Sea water often fills up the troughs between the distributaries, resulting in swamps.</p>

                <h5>The Indus Delta</h5>
                <p>The Indus delta has 'tidal flats' with mangrove swamps. The coastal area is generally low and flat. The Indus Delta is located to the east of Karachi and includes Thatta, Keti Bandar, Jati, Ladian and other small settlements. It has a low population density because the land is constantly exposed to the effects of sea water in form of waves and tides. Agriculture is limited to only a few areas due to swampy land covered with sea water, saline soil and a low annual rainfall (125mm-250mm). Infrastructure is not well developed discouraging the growth of commercial and industrial activities.</p>
                <p>For example, un-metalled roads which connect different parts of the area are not suitable for heavy transport vehicles. Local communities are involved in fishing. Mangrove trees are used as fuel wood and their leaves as fodder for animals. Occasional tropical cyclones cause damage to farming areas, fishing and the shanty homes of the people.</p>
                
                <h5>Rolling Sand Plains</h5>
                <p>(Discussed under the topic "The Desert Areas")</p>
                
                <h5>Cuestas in the Lower Indus Plain</h5>
                <p>Prominent features occurring on the Lower Indus Plain are cuestas (or escarpments). These are ridges which, in Sindh, are made of limestone. A cuesta has a steep (or scarp) slope on one side and has a gentle (or dip) slope on the other side as shown on Fig. 1.63.</p>

                <p>The Rohri cuesta attains a height of 80 m and is 48 km long. The Gango Takkar cuesta stretches southwards from Hyderabad for a distance of 24 km. These limestone ridges provide a firm foundation for the construction of barrages for irrigation. They also add to the scenic beauty of the area by varying the generally flat landscape.</p>
                
                <h4>Economic Activities in the Indus Plain</h4>
                <p>The Indus Plain is the most productive region of Pakistan. The relief and drainage of the Indus Plain encourages the growth of settlements. The doabs of the Upper Indus Plain and the old and active flood plains of the Lower Indus Plains are excellent areas for farming. Since ancient times more than 80% of the total cultivated area of Pakistan has been located in the Indus Plain. Crops are grown the whole year round on the fertile flat land and undulating slopes; cotton, rice and sugar-cane are grown in summer and wheat in winter, for example. An extensive system of canal irrigation has been developed because of the favourable relief for the construction of canals.</p>
                <p>The Indus Plain is the most developed region of Pakistan. Infrastructure facilities are available. The transport network of road, rail, etc. is dense. Electricity is supplied to all the big centres like Lahore, Faisalabad, Gujranwala, Sukkur and Hyderabad. Many of the rural areas have been supplied with electricity. The Indus Plain has a number of industries which consume local raw material e.g. cotton textiles, sugar mills, chemical industry. The industrial goods have a large domestic and foreign market. The population density varies from 50 to over 400 people per sq. km.</p>
                
                <h4>The Desert Areas</h4>
                <p>Desert areas in Pakistan are located at three places (Fig. 1.67).</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The Sindh Sagar Doab or Thal Desert is located between the River Indus and River Jhelum.</li>
                    <li>The Thar Desert is located towards south-eastern Pakistan. It is also called the south-eastern desert. It can further be divided into three main areas:
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Cholistan</li>
                            <li>Nara</li>
                            <li>Tharparkar (Thar)</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>The Kharan Desert.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Winds are the most important agent in desert areas and they change the landscape constantly. Rolling sand dunes, weathering of rocks, lack of vegetation and bare rocks are the main features.</p>

                <h4>Topographical / Relief Features of the Thar Desert</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sand plains / pattis (strips of sand formed by the action of wind)</li>
                    <li>Gently undulating plain</li>
                    <li>Sand dunes / ridges which are longitudinal / latitudinal</li>
                    <li>The wide interdunal valleys (between the sand dunes) with silty and clayey sediments (useful for cultivation)</li>
                    <li>Barren / bare-rock due to lack of water</li>
                    <li>Cracks in rocks due to effects of weathering</li>
                    <li>Rolling sand hills</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Life in desert areas is predominantly affected by the environment. Lack of water and constant erosion of land by strong winds does not allow for productive human activities e.g. farming. However, desert areas can be made productive if irrigation facilities are provided. A major part of Thar Desert has been converted into farmland by canals from the Sukkur Barrage built on the Indus. The area may have rich mineral deposits, especially mineral oil, shown by the recent discovery of many oil and gas fields in the south-eastern part of the Thar desert.</p>

                    <figcaption>(Fig. 1.71) The natural topography of the desert areas does not promote settled life due to the lack of water. That's why nomadic people move from place to place along with their livestock. The photograph shows milk-selling women in Cholistan. A resting camel on the desert sand and folded tents can also be seen.</figcaption>

                    <figcaption>(Fig. 1.72) In Thar Desert, underground water storage tanks are constructed by local craftsmen with local materials. During the rainy season (once per year) the rain falls on the concrete dish-shaped yard, and goes through a small hole into the tank underneath. Once in the tank, the water is kept covered (so it doesn't evaporate) and relatively clean. A lid on the tank allows water to be withdrawn for use by the family for drinking and cooking.</figcaption>

                <h2>UNIT 2 - Climate</h2>
                <h3>Page 29</h3>
                <h4>Climate and Weather</h4>
                <p><strong>Weather</strong> refers to the atmospheric conditions (temperature, rainfall, humidity, and pressure) of any place for a short period of time. It is often localized.</p>
                <p><strong>Climate</strong> is a generalization of the day to day weather conditions over a long period of time, usually thirty years.</p>
                
                <h4>Climatic Zones</h4>
                <p>Pakistan's topographical features range from lofty mountains in the north to the coastal plains in the south. The diversity of terrain leads to a variety of climates. Climatic divisions of Pakistan are:</p>
                <ol type="A">
                    <li>Highland climate</li>
                    <li>Lowland climate</li>
                    <li>Coastal climate</li>
                    <li>Arid climate</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Fig. 2.1 shows climatic zones of Pakistan. A division into climatic zones does not imply exactly the same conditions throughout the zone. For example, northern highlands and western highlands fall in the same climatic zone but the amount and seasonal distribution of rainfall is different. Murree and Hazara experience more than 1500 mm average annual rainfall mostly during the summer season, whereas in the western highlands Quetta and Pishin receive 250-500 mm average annual rainfall. Winter is the wettest season.</p>
                
                <h5>A. Highland Climate</h5>
                <p>This region includes northern, north-western and western highlands. The winters are long, cold and snowy and the summers remain short and mild.</p>
                <p>In mountainous areas rainfall is normally associated with altitude. The height of the Northern Mountains range from 2000 metres to above 8000 metres, while in the Western Mountains the height is approximately from 1000 to over 4000 metres. Rainfall in the Northern Mountains is the highest in the highland zone. The Western Mountains experience less rainfall. From south of Kohat and Waziristan rainfall decreases and occurs during the winter season. To the north-west, Gilgit and Chitral also experience low rainfall, as they are rainshadow areas.</p>
                <p>The temperature conditions also vary from north to west depending on the altitude. Summers are short, mild and wet in the Northern Mountains but dry and warm in the Western Mountains.</p>

                <h5>B. Lowland Climate (semi-arid to arid)</h5>
                <p>This region includes the whole of the Indus Plain except the coastal areas. Most parts of the Indus Plain lie at the western end of the tropical monsoon zone. It has arid and extreme climate with hot summers, cool winters and summer monsoon rainfall. The amount of rainfall differs from north to south. The foothills of the Northern Mountains and Potwar Plateau are wetter than the Indus Plain, and also receive rainfall from Western Depressions. Thunderstorms are also common in the north and north-west of the Indus Plain. The southern Upper Indus Plain and the whole of the Lower Indus Plain have much less rainfall and spells of very high temperature.</p>
                
                <h5>C. Coastal Climate</h5>
                <p>This region includes the southern coastal strip comprising of the Indus Delta, Karachi and the whole of the Makran coast. The climate is dominated by sea breezes throughout the year. The maritime influence keeps the daily range of temperature low. This shows that the influence of sea is felt mainly through the prevailing winds. The temperature at sea and on land is different owing to unequal heating of land and water by the sun. In summer the land heats up, while the ocean remains comparatively cool. In winter the land loses heat quickly and becomes cold while the ocean is much warmer. The humidity level is moderately high, exceeding more than 50% from April to September. Rainfall is scanty throughout the year.</p>
                
                <h5>D. Arid Climate</h5>
                <p>An arid climate is experienced in south-western Balochistan and the south-eastern desert. It is markedly dry and hot. Hot dusty winds prevail almost continuously from mid-May to mid-September. Most of the scanty rainfall in south-western Balochistan takes place during the winter season.</p>

                <h4>Pakistan: the Seasons</h4>
                <p>Pakistan has four seasons that can be distinguished as follows: Winter (mid-December to March); early summer (April to June); late summer (monsoon) (July to September); post monsoon (October to Mid December).</p>
                <p>The table Fig. 2.3 explains the temperature, rainfall and pressure conditions that normally prevail in Pakistan with reference to some particular areas.</p>
                
                <h4>Climatic Elements</h4>
                <p>There are four main climatic elements - temperature, pressure, rainfall and winds. These are responsible for the regional and seasonal variations in the climates of Pakistan.</p>
                
                <h5>Temperature</h5>
                <p>Diversity of temperature in various regions is due to the following factors:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Large spread of latitude from 24°N to 37°N.</li>

                <p>Coastal areas have moderate temperature during summer and winter. Sea breezes dominate the climate lowering the daily range of temperature.</p>
                
                <h4>Factors affecting temperature of Pakistan</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Latitudinal effect:</strong> The areas closer to the Equator receive relatively direct rays of the sun resulting in high temperature. Southern Pakistan is closer to the Equator than Northern Pakistan.</li>
                    <li><strong>Continental effect:</strong> It is a general term covering the climate of those areas protected from or unaffected by maritime influence. Maritime influence means the influence of the sea on temperatures. This is why extreme winter and summer temperatures are recorded in the interior of large landmasses away from the moderating influence of sea.</li>
                    <li><strong>Altitude and temperature:</strong> There is a relationship between altitude, air density and temperature. The air is densest at sea level. Air is least dense at high altitude because less solar radiation is absorbed. With less air to absorb heat at higher altitude, there is an average drop of 6.5° C in temperature for each 1000 metre increase in altitude.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cloud cover and temperature:</strong> Cloud cover affects temperature to some extent. In the daytime it reduces the amount of incoming solar radiation. At night the cloud cover traps the outgoing heat. As a result, temperature on a cloudy night does not drop as low as temperature on a clear night.</li>
                    <li><strong>Latitude and the angle of the sun:</strong> The term 'angle of the sun' refers to the position of the Earth in relation to the sun. Latitudinal position determines the amount of heat received by the Earth. The sun's rays falling near the North and South Poles have to heat a larger surface area and travel further through the atmosphere, having less heating effect.</li>
                </ul>

                    <figcaption>(Fig. 2.8 - Table: Seasonal and Regional Variations in Temperature) This table describes and explains the seasonal and regional variations. In the Highland zone the temperature falls below 5°C during winter, causing snowfall on most of the mountain peaks. Summers are mild and pleasant.

                <h3>Page 33: Rainfall</h3>
                <p>...Similarly the difference in the heat received in summer and winter is due to the difference in the angle of sun.</p>
                <p>During summer, the northern hemisphere (Pakistan is located in the northern hemisphere north of the Tropic of Cancer) is tilted towards the sun and therefore the land absorbs more heat because:</p>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>of the high angle of the sun and</li>
                    <li>it faces the sun for longer duration (longer days and shorter nights).</li>
                </ol>
                <p>During winter, the northern hemisphere is tilted away from the sun (i.e. a low angle of the sun) so the earth absorbs less heat.</p>
                
                <h4>Rainfall</h4>
                <p>Fig. 2.9 shows that most of the areas of Pakistan are arid or semi-arid. Only in a few northern areas humid conditions are found. The rainfall generally decreases from the Himalayas towards the south.</p>
                
                <h5>Sources of Rainfall in Pakistan</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Monsoon winds</li>
                    <li>The Western Depressions</li>

                </ul>
                
                <h5>The Monsoon Winds</h5>
                <p>The word monsoon means a season. These winds are seasonal. The summer winds are called South-west monsoons and the winter winds are called North-east monsoons.</p>
                <p>South-west monsoons are giant sea breezes, which bring heavy rainfall. The rains begin when the summer sun heats up tropical continents much faster than the oceans. Warm air rising overland creates a low pressure, which attracts cool, moist air from the sea, causing heavy rainfall.</p>
                <p>North-east monsoons blow from the land towards the sea. During winter a high-pressure area is created over the Tropic of Cancer. Winds blow from land to sea, which is a low-pressure area. These winds are mostly dry and bring no significant change.</p>

                <p>The map Fig. 2.11b shows that the main monsoon winds blow from the Bay of Bengal. After crossing Bangladesh and North India, the tail end of the wind enters northern Pakistan. The winds normally start to blow in June and cause heavy rainfall in northern Punjab in July. The graph for Lahore Fig. 2.12 shows that the mean rainfall in both July and August is 125 mm.</p>
                <p>The map Fig. 2.11b shows that some monsoon winds blow across south-east Pakistan from the Arabian Sea. These are weak winds and have little effect. However, sometimes an over-active monsoon system brings heavy monsoon rainfall in Karachi and coastal areas of Sindh damaging the infrastructure of the region.</p>
                <p>The graph for Karachi (Fig. 2.13), shows that the total rainfall in July, August and September is considerably lower than that in Lahore.</p>
                
                <h4>Western Depressions</h4>
                <p>Western Depressions are the cyclones which originate in the Mediterranean Sea, travel across Afghanistan and Iran then reach the western areas of Pakistan. After striking the north-western areas such as Peshawar and northern Pakistan, the winds move towards western and south-western parts. By the time they reach south-western Balochistan they are robbed of their moisture.</p>

                <h3>Page 35: Convectional Currents & Relief Rainfall</h3>
                <p>...These winds cause the rainfall in these areas from December to March. For example, Quetta receives most of its rainfall during the winter seasons. (Fig. 2.15).</p>
                
                <h4>Convectional Currents</h4>
                <p>At the start of summer, hot air rises up which also contains a high moisture content. When it reaches the higher layers of the atmosphere, condensation takes place (Fig. 2.16). This causes rainfall, often as thunderstorms. Strong winds accompanying the storms may pick up dust as well.</p>
                <p>Only the northern and north-western areas of Pakistan receive rainfall from convectional currents. Southern Pakistan is deprived of convectional rainfall due to a temperature inversion layer. Look at the temperature and rainfall graphs (Figs 2.17 and 2.18) for Rawalpindi and Peshawar. These areas receive some rainfall in early summer caused by convectional currents.</p>
                <p>Fig. 2.19. shows that a temperature inversion layer does not allow condensation to take place at the height of 1600 m. As a result warm air descends and no rainfall occurs. That is why Karachi and adjoining areas do not receive convectional rainfall although the maximum daily temperature crosses 40°C in the month of May/June and October.</p>
                
                <h4>Relief Rainfall</h4>
                <p>Relief rainfall is related to the height of land. It occurs where moist unstable air moves up a mountain or scarp edge, and it is chilled. This chilling causes heavy condensation and precipitation, on the windward side. The lee slopes tend to receive sinking, warming air, and a dry 'rain shadow' area may lie leeward of the barrier. This is shown in Fig. 2.20.</p>

                <p>In the north and north-western area where there is high altitude, some of the rainfall is due to relief. Figs 2.22 and 2.23 show that Murree and Kakul receive rainfall in almost all seasons due to high altitude and other sources mentioned.</p>
                
                <h4>Tropical Cyclones</h4>
                <p>Tropical cyclones may bring a few hours of very heavy rainfall with destructive winds to the coastal areas. They originate over the Arabian Sea quite often but only rarely do they reach the coast of Pakistan, usually once every few years. Therefore, this source of rainfall is totally unreliable both in terms of when and where on the coast it will occur. (See also page 43-44).</p>
                
                <h4>Pressure and Winds</h4>
                <p>During the summer season, the temperature over central Pakistan is high. This causes the hot air to rise up and form a low-pressure zone. At the same time oceans and seas have comparatively low temperature. The air pressure over the oceans and seas is higher than over the land during summer. This leads to the movements of monsoon winds from sea to land, which are moisture-laden and bring heavy rainfall to the upper and lower Indus Plain in the months of July and August.</p>

                <h4>Effectiveness of Rainfall</h4>
                <p>The rainfall in Pakistan is mainly from monsoon winds and Western Depressions. The monsoon winds bring rainfall during the summer season, which is variable in amount, timings and distribution. Another factor that limits the usefulness of rainfall is high temperature conditions from June to September over the Indus Plain. This leads to a great degree of evapo-transpiration. Monsoon rainfall comes in heavy showers, which is not very useful for the crops, because the land does not absorb the rainwater. Most of the water from the monsoon rainfall drains away causing floods.</p>
                <p>The variable nature of monsoon rainfall also lessens its usefulness for the farmers. Crop planning is very difficult.</p>
                <p>Only a tiny fraction of the Potwar Plateau has canal irrigation. For the rest, it is 'barani land' because of impracticability of lifting irrigation water.</p>
                <p>The winter rainfall is more effective for farmers because it comes in light showers that continue for several days. However, the amount of winter rainfall is not sufficient and cannot be relied upon.</p>

                <p>...in this region and economic activities are difficult to carry out.</p>
                <p>As you move towards the south, temperature increases in both summer and winter. The Western Highlands and barren mountains of Balochistan are also sparsely populated due to harsh physical conditions. Annual rainfall is 125-250 mm in most of the areas and occurs mainly during winter. Lack of water supply discourages human settlements. Crop cultivation is also difficult in these areas. However, apples, mangoes, apricots and grapes are grown in the valleys of high altitude areas. The highland areas of Balochistan with cold and dry climate and winter rains due to depressions, are suitable for the growing of fruits. Other crops include millet, wheat, and barley.</p>
                
                <h4>Arid Zone</h4>
                <p>This zone occurs in two parts; the south eastern deserts and the Kharan Desert (including the Chagai Hills). The climate is one of extremes; with low annual rainfall, cool-mild winters and hot summers.</p>
                <p>The majority of the people are nomadic and belong to such groups as the Brahuis, Balochis and Pathans. They move with their animals in search of food and water. Due to scanty rainfall and excessive evapo-transpiration, a unique system of underground irrigation 'Karez' - is practised. Karez is a narrow sub-terranean canal, which starts from the base of the hills where subsoil water is present. This indigenous method prevents the water from being evaporated.</p>
                <p>In terms of rainfall, desert covers almost the whole of Sindh and the southern part of Punjab. The area receives only 100mm of annual rainfall. Under such extreme heat and low precipitation, crop cultivation is very difficult. However large areas have been reclaimed for farming through the construction of perennial canals. In those areas rice, wheat, cotton and oilseeds are cultivated. The remaining areas of the Thar desert are still barren desert. The lifestyle of the people is also affected by the climate. They wear thick and rough clothes to protect themselves from hot winds.</p>
                
                <h4>Lowland Zone - Semi-arid to Arid</h4>
                <p>The fertile plain of Punjab, drained by the Indus and its four tributaries has a continental or extreme type of climate. In the daytime summers are extremely hot. Winters are cool to mild. Economically, the Punjab Plain is the most productive agricultural region of Pakistan. In view of the generally varied and irregular rainfall, there is a well-developed canal irrigation system to raise crops like wheat, millet, cotton and sugarcane.</p>

                <div class="q-box">
                    <p>"The Thar Desert is a water deficient area and it can be reclaimed by constructing seasonal/flood canals from the Sukkur Barrage to increase production of food."</p>
                    <p>"The Thar Desert is rich in mineral resources such as coal and oil. It is more feasible to invest in the setting up of coal-fired thermal power plants than to use the land for farming."</p>
                    <p><strong>Which statement do you agree with more? Give reasons...</strong></p>
                </div>
                <p>Punjab is the most densely populated province of Pakistan because of its alluvial plains, moderate rainfall and tolerable summer and winter temperatures.</p>
                
                <h4>Life and Economy in Thar Desert: A case study</h4>
                <p>The Thar Desert is located to the south-east of Pakistan. It is a dry sandy desert of about 22,000 square kilometres. Crops of guar, millet, mung bean, and sesame are grown on about 4/5 of this cultivated land. The agriculture depends on rainfall except in a few canal irrigated areas.</p>
                <p>The soil is sandy but also contains fine particles of clay and silt which make it fertile. The rain is collected in the traditional style in ponds and tanks. Rainfall is the only source of surface and groundwater. The low rainfall occurs during the monsoon season from July to September. The high temperatures result in high rates of evaporation. More water is evaporated than is supplied by the rainfall.</p>
                <p>The land suffers a lot on account of drought, which may last from 3 to 5 years.</p>
                <p>The results are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>scarcity of water,</li>
                    <li>food shortages,</li>
                    <li>poverty posing risks to life,</li>
                    <li>danger to the livestock.</li>

                <p>Problems in the Thar Desert are varied. The water shortage is a chronic one. Before the onset of rains, the farmers make bunds and dig pits to retain rainwater in sandy soils. The water is collected into man-made ditches and natural hollows. The rainwater may also be stored in earthen jars, household utensils, and underground cemented tanks. It is also stored on the roofs of "Pucca" houses.</p>
                
                <h4>What of the Future?</h4>
                <p>The establishment of tree plantations and the construction of a seasonal canal from the Sukkur Barrage to bring flood water would increase the production of food crops. More rainfall needs to be collected to provide drinking water for humans and animals.</p>
                
                <h4>Coastal Zone</h4>
                <p>Pakistan has a delta coastline in Sindh and the hilly Makran coast in Balochistan. Karachi, Thatta and Badin are important centres on the Sindh coast and Gwadar, Ormara and Pasni are located on the Makran coast.</p>
                <p>Karachi has a mild climate with a low average precipitation (approximately 250 mm per annum), the bulk of which occurs during the July-August monsoon season. Winters are mild and the summers are hot. However, the proximity to the sea maintains humidity at a high level (60%-70%) and cool sea breezes relieve the heat.</p>
                <p>The climate of the Makran Coast is dry and hot. The maximum temperature in June remains between 31°C and 40°C. The oceanic influence keeps the temperature lower than the inland areas in summer and higher in winter. Humidity prevails all along the coast and average annual rainfall is below 250 mm.</p>
                <p>The extent of precipitation affects the supply of drinking water in Gwadar district as most of it is provided from reservoirs which are rain-dependent. The moderate climate was one of the important factors in the development of Gwadar port.</p>

                <p>All these factors result in a decline in the economic activity of the people.</p>
                <p>The peasants and farmers of Thar prepare their lands and grow local crops and green fodder for animals, which are reared in this dry region. The desert lets natural vegetation flourish after rains. This includes herbs, shrubs, grasses and pastures, which helps boost the Thar economy and also provide food, feed and fuel for the local population. The locals rely on these resources rather than seeking aid from the funding agencies. The rains increase the opportunities to produce more food by growing cereals. There is ample production of milk, butter and meat from domestic animals and livestock during the rainy season.</p>
                <p>Problems in the Thar Desert are varied as listed above. The water shortage in terms of crop cultivation and for drinking purposes is a chronic one. The sandy soils do not hold water for long periods. Thus farmers start preparing their lands to sow seeds either before or soon after the rainfall, in order to take advantage of the moisture in the soil before it evaporates.</p>
                <p>Before the onset of rains, the farmers make bunds, dig pits and go for village practices of retaining the rainwater in sandy soils for crop cultivation. The water thus is collected into man-made ditches and natural hollows.</p>
                <p>The rainwater may also be stored in earthen jars, household utensils, overhead as well as underground cemented tanks. It is also stored on the roofs of "Pucca" houses with solid borders. The capacity of such water containers and reservoirs is not enough to meet the drinking water needs of the population living in the area. But ample quantity of rainfall during a particular season may saturate the deeper layers of the soil, thus recharging the subsoil and raise the underground level of sweet water and also recharge wells dug in the area.</p>
                
                <h4>What of the Future?</h4>
                <p>The establishment of tree plantations and the construction of a seasonal canal from the Sukkur Barrage to bring flood water would increase the production of food crops and help to bring prosperity to the area. More rainfall needs to be collected to provide drinking water for humans and animals and an increase in the grass and greenery in the desert might also attract some tourists.</p>
                
                <h4>Coastal Zone</h4>
                <p>Pakistan has a delta coastline in Sindh and the hilly Makran coast in Balochistan. Karachi, Thatta and Badin are important centres on the Sindh coast and Gwadar, Ormara and Pasni are located on the Makran coast.</p>

                <p>The climate of the Makran Coast is dry and hot. The maximum temperature in June remains between 31°C and 40°C and in the coolest month of January it varies from 18°C to 19°C. The oceanic influence keeps the temperature lower than the inland areas in summer and higher in winter. Humidity prevails all along the coast and average annual rainfall is below 250 mm.</p>
                <p>The extent of precipitation affects the supply of drinking water in Gwadar district as most of it is provided from reservoirs which are rain-dependent. The moderate climate was one of the important factors in the development of Gwadar port as it would make it operational throughout the year for trade activities.</p>

                <h3>Page 42: Coastal Zone Economics & River Floods</h3>
                <p>Due to the mild climate of the Sindh coast, economic activities can be carried on throughout the year. Farming is possible almost throughout the year depending on the availability of water from irrigation channels. The seaports are open all the year round to carry out international trade. Road and rail transport links to inland areas are never closed for business and economic activities. Air flights are rarely cancelled due to climatic reasons. All types of industries ranging from cottage and small-scale to large-scale manufacturing are operational in all seasons.</p>
                <p>However, during summer months, tropical cyclones sometimes cause coastal flooding in low-lying areas causing damage to infrastructure, shanty homes and farming land of the Indus Delta. Fishing is nearly impossible when the sea is wild. Thus fishing communities suffer economic losses due to tropical cyclones.</p>
                
                <h4>River Floods</h4>
                <p>Rivers provide an attraction for human settlement and economic development. Water is a vital resource to people for drinking, washing, industrial processes, leisure, agriculture and transport. However, excessive water in the rivers may cause floods.</p>
                <p>The Indus and its tributaries swell, and almost every year overflow their banks. The flood in most years is not serious. However every 7 - 8 years there are severe floods. Serious floods occurred in 1955, 1973 and 1978. In the 80s and 90s serious floods also occurred causing large-scale devastation.</p>
                <p>In 1955 a flood inundated 2420 villages; 400 people and 70,000 cattle lost their lives. The Ravi Syphon (a canal to release water to the fields) was destroyed. The total damage caused by floods amounted to Rs. 83 million.</p>
                <p>In 1973, floods inundated 3.6 million hectares, killed 1600 persons and demolished three million homes.</p>

                <h3>Page 43: Flood Management, Benefits & Storms</h3>
                <h4>What Can be Done to Reduce the Flood Risk?</h4>
                <p>Preventative and curative measures:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Planting trees on the foothills to check the flow of running water.</li>
                    <li>Enlarging the river channel so that it can hold more water.</li>
                    <li>Building embankments on either side of the channel to prevent the spread of floodwater.</li>
                    <li>Building extra channels to take floodwater away from towns.</li>
                    <li>Building reservoirs on the river to store water and control peak discharge.</li>
                    <li>Preventing building in areas where flooding is most likely.</li>
                    <li>Publicizing flood warnings through radio, television and newspapers.</li>
                    <li>Evacuation of flooded areas and providing necessary facilities for rehabilitation.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Benefits of Floods</h4>
                <p>Although flooding can be devastating to an unprepared community, it is a natural event with a purpose.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Floods return nutrients to the land and contribute to the health of wetlands as in the Indus delta.</li>
                    <li>Floods distribute rich sediment and refresh streams. Floods spread a layer of alluvium, which increases the fertility of the land.</li>
                    <li>Allowing rivers and streams to overflow their banks naturally can prevent more serious flooding downstream.</li>
                    <li>The relatively high level of fish production in the Arabian Sea is attributed to the nutrient rich delta of the Indus river system.</li>
                    <li>The reproduction, breeding and multiplication of inland fresh water fish and prawn species is finely tuned and adjusted to the monsoon flooding.</li>
                    <li>Floods also recharge ground water supplies.</li>

                <p>Thunderstorms are common in the northern and north-western areas of Pakistan. In the summer (April to June) and the post-monsoon season (Sept-Oct), the atmospheric pressure falls and convectional currents cause sporadic and localized rainfall in the extreme north and the Safed Koh Mountains. This is accompanied by strong winds from 60 - 80 km per hour. Stormy rainfall and hail also occur as a result of these winds, which cause the destruction of apples, pears and other crops grown there.</p>

                <h5>Types of Drought</h5>
                <p>There are four different ways of categorizing drought.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Permanent drought</strong> exists when crop cultivation is not possible without irrigation e.g. Thal, Cholistan, Chagai (Western Balochistan).</li>
                    <li><strong>Seasonal drought</strong> occurs in areas with well-defined rainy and dry seasons, e.g Potwar Plateau, southern Punjab.</li>
                    <li><strong>Invisible drought</strong> is the result of a water deficiency that reduces crop yields but is not severe enough to destroy them.</li>
                    <li><strong>Unpredictable drought</strong> is the result of abnormally low rainfall and occurs in areas which have humid climates.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In the summer season, in southern plains and north-western parts of Balochistan, due to low pressure, dust storms and strong winds are also experienced. Tropical cyclones from the Arabian Sea can also affect the coastal areas of Sindh and Balochistan. In May 1999, a tropical cyclone '2A' hit the coastal areas of Sindh, causing wide-spread damage.</p>
                
                <h5>Causes of Drought in Pakistan</h5>
                <p><strong>Natural Factors</strong> that can lead to drought in Pakistan are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unreliability of monsoon winds may lead to seasonal drought in Punjab and Sindh.</li>
                    <li>The dry and hot winds can reduce the moisture contents of sandy soil.</li>
                    <li>Global climate is constantly changing leading to changes in Pakistan's climate.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Human Factors</strong> that may lead to drought conditions in Pakistan are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Deforestation on the foothills of mountains increases soil erosion and reduces rainfall.</li>
                    <li>Mismanagement of water resources through seepage of unlined canals etc.</li>
                    <li>The disputed and unfair distribution of water between the provinces.</li>
                    <li>Overgrazing of land, leading to soil erosion thus reducing soil fertility.</li>
                    <li>Global warming leading to climate changes.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Page 45: Effects of Drought</h3>
                <h4>How 2000-01 Drought Affected Pakistan</h4>
                <p>In Pakistan permanent and seasonal droughts affect the life and economy of the desert areas of Sindh and Balochistan to a great extent. In 2001 the 26 districts of Balochistan suffered from severe famine as a result of drought. Out of these 26 districts the famine situation in 22 districts had reached crisis point. Many people were trapped in inaccessible areas. The lives of some 20,000 families and more than a million cattle were severely affected.</p>

                    <li>the use of the varieties of seeds for crop cultivation which are drought-resistant and consume less water.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The lining of canals to avoid the wastage and uneconomical use of existing water resources. In Pakistan large amounts of canal water are wasted due to seepage from unlined canals causing waterlogging and salinity.</p>
                <p>Planning and management of water resources.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, the government should ensure that high priority is given to the allocation of the water resources for the basic needs of the people and of the economy, i.e. for agricultural and industrial uses.</p>
